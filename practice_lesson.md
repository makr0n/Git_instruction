## 1. Checking  installed git version

Execute command `git version` in terminal.
If git is installed, a message with current version will appear. If not, message with an error.

## 2. Git install
Download latest version of git from https://git-scm.com/downloads. Install it.

## 3. Git setting
First use: you have to introduce yourself by entering two commands:
```
git config --global user.name "Your name"
git config --global user.mail "e-mail"
```

## 4. Creating your first repository

After setting git you have to create __repository__ for your further work. To do this, use the command `git init` in terminal.
After this you receive next message:

---
Initialized empty Git repository in (Path to your  directory)

---

## 5.Work with repository
 
Next thing to do is creating new file in your repository (or maybe copying one). For example create file "practice_lesson.md". Always remember that the **file must have an extension**. 

Git doesn't control your file yet, we need to tell it to do this by using command `git add (file_name)`. After this git starts to control versions of added file and you can work further.
